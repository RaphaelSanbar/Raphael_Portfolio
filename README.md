## [Divvy Bike Report](https://github.com/RaphaelSanbar/Divvy_Bikes)

This report analyses data from the Divvy bike-sharing program in Chicago, focusing on trends in customer behavior, bike usage, and rental patterns from April to June 2021. The analysis revealed key insights, such as the significant preference for classic bikes over electric and docked bikes, a decline in usage beginning in June, and variations in usage patterns between members and casual riders. Casual riders showed increased activity on weekends and holidays, while members had consistent peak usage during weekday rush hours. Furthermore, rental durations varied, with members completing most rides in under 20 minutes, compared to longer durations for casual riders.

The report was developed using SQL for data preprocessing, Power BI for visualisation and analysis, complemented by Excel and Python for advanced statistical analysis. These tools enabled the cleaning, integration, and examination of over 1 million ride records to provide actionable insights into customer preferences and operational patterns for Divvy bikes.

## [Customer Churning Report](https://github.com/RaphaelSanbar/Churn_Rate)

This report investigates customer churn patterns for a fictional internet and phone service provider in California, leveraging a dataset of over 7,000 customer records. The analysis identifies key factors influencing churn, including demographics, service preferences, and account details. Significant findings include higher churn rates among seniors, customers with multiple dependents, and those on month-to-month contracts or electronic check payment methods. Additionally, customers with premium tech support or online security exhibited slightly lower churn rates, while satisfaction scores strongly correlated with retention, with scores below 3 indicating a high likelihood of churn.

The report was developed using SQL for data preprocessing, Power BI for visualisation and Excel for supplementary exploration. These tools facilitated the identification of actionable trends, enabling recommendations for customer retention strategies such as promoting longer-term contracts, addressing dissatisfaction among specific demographics, and reevaluating service offerings like fiber-optic internet.
